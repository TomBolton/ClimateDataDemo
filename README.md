# Climate Data Demonstration

The main component of this repo is a jupyter notebook, that can be run interactively on MyBinder.org by anyone with a link. This is for the programming session of the 2018 Oxford NERC DTP Summer School, on July 12th. The notebook will load surface air temperature data from ERA-Interim, and do some simple analysis and visualisations. All the data needed for this exercise is saved in the folder called 'data'.
