The strong west-to-east currents of both these systems stops chlorophyll being mixed in the north-south direction; this causes there to be a sharp divide between high values above the currents, and low chlorophyll values below the currents. This phenomena is called a \"mixing barrier\" and has important implications, not only for biological systems but for climate as a whole. \n",
